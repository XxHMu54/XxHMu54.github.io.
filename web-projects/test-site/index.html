    <h3>What we offer?</h3>
     <p>We offer great services, as two seasons professionals, spending vast years and experience,research and 
        academic knowlegde into this space. offer
        something a lot more digestable for beginners, helo
        you spend less time. I am tryna help the fellow 
        that i was 5 years ago. Life is all about levarage
        yes i understand, you probably think paying for this 
        course could be a scam, i get it. In this market
        where everybodys tryna sell you stuff, how can you belief
        if you truly want to get ahead of others, you need to use others
        life expeirnces. As a kid i use to constantly watch youtube
        for this exact reasons, i was looking for the answers through these 
        content creators. Especially when it came to the gym and it was good sure
        they would relay their experience, what worked for them. But free knowledge will
        give you levearge sure, but there are soo many gaps, so many grey areas, you will have
        to figure out. Now im not saying you wont experience this with a mentor, you will, but it will
        be sooo much <strenght>less</strenght>. Tap into excellence, we have years in experience, and gone
        through the struggle

        <h3>Why Choose us?</h3>
        <p>I think an underappreviated, undertalked about 
            subject when it comes to business, is <em>integrity </em>.
            I wanna be able to provide value and am willing to proove it
            hence, why we will offer one free program, see the diffenrece in gains,
            take a 7 day mentorship trial too, and see the value, now i understand
            maybe you are a teenager, you just want some help, and as a kid, i spent money
            on pre workout suplements, spend ridiculous amount of time on studying 
            gym knowledge from everybdoy you know, did it give me gains? sure. But 
            so much gray areas. I would also recoommend being your own coach, and i understand
            individual varience, having a PT is a levarage, well it can be if with the right
            pt if not it could potentially do the opposite, thats why it is critical to
            have a certified PT, now idk what me telling you my inexperiences with training clients
            i can only show you my progress and what worked for me.
